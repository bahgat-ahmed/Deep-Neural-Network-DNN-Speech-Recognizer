# Deep Neural Network(DNN) Speech Recognizer

This is the project I have built in the third course of the NLP Nanodegree. The course name is **Commincating with Natural Language**. In this project I have built a deep neural 
network (DNN) that functions as part of an end-to-end automatic speech recognition pipeline.

The following section is all taken as it is from the project description made by Udacity.

## Tasks
The tasks for this project are outlined in the `vui_notebook.ipynb` in three steps. Follow all the instructions, which include implementing code in `sample_models.py`, answering 
questions, and providing results. The following list is a summary of the required tasks.

## Step 1 - Feature Extraction
* Execute all code cells to extract features from raw audio

## Step 2 - Acoustic Model

* Implement the code for Models 1, 2, 3, and 4 in `sample_models.py`
* Train Models 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 in the notebook
* Execute the comparison code in the notebook
* Answer Question 1 in the notebook regarding the comparison
* Implement the code for the Final Model in `sample_models.py`
* Train the Final Model in the notebook
* Answer Question 2 in the notebook regarding your final model

## Step 3 - Decoder

* Execute the prediction code in the notebook
